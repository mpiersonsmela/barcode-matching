# barcode-matching

This code is for matching Illumina reads to a list of short DNA barcodes. It requires that BBtools are installed, for merging paired-end reads. The inputs are a directory containing .fastq.gz files, and a list of barcodes. The output is a .csv file of barcode counts. Matching is performed by alignment; see comments in "illumina_align_known_barcodes.py"

The test data was generated by a MiSeq.
